Please read the tips.

## Tips ##
* It works using old password manager, which was removed while ago, and not affect 'about:logins' page.
  * I just tossed old files [someone saved](https://github.com/xiaoxiaoflood/firefox-scripts/tree/master/chrome/utils/passwordmgr) and addon's code together. Sadly no l10n files were packed thus password manager will only display in english.
* :warning: If using Waterfox and/or bootstrapLoader the browser __must__ be restarted after installation!
  * (If using userChromeJS the startup cache may need to be cleared between updates.)
